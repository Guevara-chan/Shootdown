# 「Reassembling」
__Shootdøwn__ was written entirelly in _Boo v0.9.7.0_ with auxiliary build script provided in _Shell_.  
It requires [IlMerge](https://github.com/Microsoft/ILMerge) and [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to be installed and properly refernced in _build.cmd_ for recompilation.
